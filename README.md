Hi 👋 I'm Shawn (He/Him). 

I'm primarily a frontend developer, specializing in Javascript, from the cold snowy central lands of Canada. 

Besides programming I love to play video games 🎮, build Gundam models (Gunpla) 🤖, and chill with my dog Bonnie 🐶.

I'm trying to get more in to open-source coding / projects to spend more time at home / free time programming to help better my skills.

## 📚 What I'm Learning:
* [ ] **Rust - Hands-on learning and Game Development with rust**
* [ ] **C# - Unity Game Development**
* [ ] **French! - Je m'appelle Shawn!**
